# Understanding concepts of algorithms and data structures using C

In this unit students were asked to complete a series of tasks (`tasks.pdf`) related to the material learnt using a language of their choice to which I have chosen to use C. All code files can be found in the `code` directory corresponding to the task they tackle and the report (`report.pdf`) contains software testing (i.e. expected vs actual results). 

This study-unit introduces the student to the concepts of algorithms and data-structures. Particular emphasis is placed on the time and space complexity of algorithms. The unit introduces the basic abstract data structures such as Stack, Queue, Linked List, ADT Table, Heap, Tree, and Graph. Trees, in particular, are treated in detail with coverage of binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, and B-Trees. The unit also discusses various sorting, tree traversal, graph processing algorithms as well as a discussion of the Big O notation.

A brief overview of the tasks are as follows:
<ul>
<li>finding all 2-pairs of integers that have the same product in a list of integers</li>
<li>write a program that uses an ADT stack to evaluate arithmetic expressions in RPN format</li>
<li>write a boolean function that checks if a number is prime</li>
<li>building a Binary Search Tree (BST) for a sequence of integers</li>
<li>write a function thatt approximates the square root of a number using the Newton Raphson method</li>
<li>write a program in smallest time complexity to find all integers in an array that are repeated more than once</li>
<li>write a recursive function that finds the larget number in a list of integers</li>
<li>write a function that computes cosine/sine by taking the first n terms of the appropriate series expansion</li>
<li>write a function that returns the sum of the first n numbers of the Fibonacci sequence</li>
</ul>
